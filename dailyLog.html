    <h1>Daily Log</h1>
    <p>
        6/11/19 <br>
        It's been over 25 minutes since I started coding. I'm supposed to log after doing SOMETHING for 25 minutes.
        Since this is the first log, I'll go easy on me. I opened up my todo.html to see what
        I wanted to implement. I want to make it so my to do list goes down vertically and not horizontally.
        Right now the new task button is not doing what I intended. I started to google things like,
        "How to append new line in js" or "How to make a line break using button," but it was useless.
        I still couldn't find the answer to my question. So I thought I should look at it a different way.
        I just googled how to make a to do list and there was an example. I took look at it so I could
        have a place to start. That's when my mentor told me to make this daily log thing. He's actually told me
        multiple times to do this, but I just haven't done it or I ended up stopping my logs. I'm going to attempt
        to keep the logs going here on my website. ye. <br><br>

        6/12/19 15:00-15:30 <br>
        Shortly after opening my todo.html, I was able to figure out how to clear the textbox when creating
        a task and also make the "enter" key trigger the add task button click. I was able to do this because
        my googling skills have gotten better.. ha.. ha, nah. Anyway I talked with my mentor and let him know
        I was going to improve my todo.html by making some sort of saving ability. He recommended I use local storage.
        I don't know anything about that yet, but I will soon enough because I will google it obviously.
        That's about all that happened in my 30 minutes. Thx 4 ur time. <br><br>

        6/12/19 15:30-19:00 <br>
        Sometime after programming, I talked with my mentor. He said that I was supposed to be writing a short log every
        25 minutes. I misunderstood and thought he meant to start programming for 25 minutes and write a log for
        that short amount of time without re-logging the rest of the day. That was what I was supposed to do... hmm...
        I didn't get a lot of things done on my own within the time frame. My mentor helped me out for a lot of the 
        work. The good news is that I was able to understand what was going on and learned about local storage and
        how to implement it in html. Much of JS is still new to me so I have been struggling to figure out how to do
        anything. The to do list is not yet complete, but it looks good so far, thanks to me and my mentor... ha..
        <br><br>

        6/13/19 16:00-22:00 <br>
        Damn, I learned a lot today. I didn't really learn that much from the tutorial that my mentor suggested to me,
        but I did learn how to learn better. Instead of just watching tons of tutorials and then trying to make something
        at the end, I created small assignments for myself along the way in a fun way so it wasn't boring. The 6 hours flew
        by so fast... amazing... I learned how to sit down and code like I was able to do during my spring session at Sac state.
        Makes me feel good about myself.
        I also learned the more indepth details of variables, constants, and etc of JS. I ended up watching 14 videos of the 
        tutorial, but that was because I skipped 3-4 of them since I knew about those topics already. That's about it, good day. <br><br>

        6/14/19 10:00-17:00 <br>
        I forgot to write my log after doing my time, so I'm logging this on the 15th. During my 5 hour study session, I started to feel
        worn out and tired, but I didn't give up. I kept rewatching a certain motivational video on YouTube until I started to code again.
        As I coded, I felt like I actually WANTED to code. On the day I started logging (6/11), I didn't want to code. It felt like a chore.
        Something that was boring and something that I didn't want to do. For some reason in 3 days, I was able to change my mindset.
        I realized how uneducated I am in coding and realized how much I wanted to get better. My life isn't a lot like my friend's lives, where
        they have parents to catch them when they fall. On the other hand, I have to catch myself before I fall. A lot of my friends
        don't realize their current state in life. They don't realize how uneducated they are and don't have a drive to get better.
        They may think they do, but I don't think they do. I am still somewhat like them, because I hang around them so much. I used to
        lay around and do nothing with them. I would just hang out all the time. I started thinking for myself and if I keep hanging out so much
        then I'm going to end up just like them. I'll be lazy, doing nothing all the time, sleeping until 12PM not doing shit. I don't want to 
        be like that. No matter how hard it is to get better, I want to get better. I didn't talk about coding much this time, but I believe this
        self reflection log is more beneficial than a coding summary for 6/14. <br><br>

        6/15/19 12:00-18:00 <br>
        Once again, I am writing the log for 6/15 on 6/16. I'm falling behind a day. I'm starting to get lazy writing these logs, but I remember
        some motivational quotes like, "I HAMMER ON THE PROJECT" and it helps me out to just do it, man. 6/16 didn't feel too productive. I got some
        headaches due to my weak posture (using weak/strong posture is better than saying bad/good posture because saying posture is weak means that
        posture can be strengthened). As for what I learned while programming, I added textbox inputs and attemepted to loop through some buttonlistenerevents
        so I did not have to recreate 5 button listener events. I was not successful, YET. HAHA. After failing to solve the button listener problem, I moved on
        to watching tutorials. A lot of the tutorial was material I already knew, so I skimmed/skipped through a bunch. I think I'm on video 25 now.
        After that, I fixed up some typoes and other things. I forgot. I really didn't want to write this log. That is all. Hammer on. <br><br>
 
        6/16/19 12:00-15:50 <br>
        Time to catch up on my logs. I'm disappointed in myself today. I wanted to hit at least 6 hours. I only did about 3 and a half of coding. Damn.
        However, in this short amount of time, I felt more productive than I was yesterday. I didn't watch any tutorials, but I added CSS to my
        website tutorial page. I changed the font, made a dymanic number system for the sections, put a background for the slowpoke, put tomato color
        behind the headings, fixed typoes, added emphasis, underlined subsections, and fixed the date. Sure sounds like a lot, DOESN'T IT? HUH?
        Well, I'm planning to code more tomorrow and get even more CSS things done. Thank you for your time. I can't wait to see me in 2-3 years with
        this pace. <br><br>

        6/17/19 3 hours (Don't remember time)<br> 
        I forgot what I did this day. I didn't do much so It's not worth logging. What I did do was spend time with my family. We went to
        dinner for father's day. I learned about how one of my friends is living at my dad's house now with my cousin, Junior. There's a long and sad
        story behind why. That's about it for today, just goof'd off like a monkey.

        6/18/19 10:00-22:00 <br>
        Grinded through all the tutorials today. Some of them were a little confusing so I couldn't write docs for them, yet. I'm going to do some
        more reasearch on the topics I didn't understand so I can write examples and code snippets. I think I added a Google search bar during
        this session.
