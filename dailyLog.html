    <h1>Daily Log REMEMBER TO CANCEL COMCAST BEFORE 1 MONTH. CANCEL AROUND 7/25/2019</h1>

        6/11/19 <br>
        It's been over 25 minutes since I started coding. I'm supposed to log after doing SOMETHING for 25 minutes.
        Since this is the first log, I'll go easy on me. I opened up my todo.html to see what
        I wanted to implement. I want to make it so my to do list goes down vertically and not horizontally.
        Right now the new task button is not doing what I intended. I started to google things like,
        "How to append new line in js" or "How to make a line break using button," but it was useless.
        I still couldn't find the answer to my question. So I thought I should look at it a different way.
        I just googled how to make a to do list and there was an example. I took look at it so I could
        have a place to start. That's when my mentor told me to make this daily log thing. He's actually told me
        multiple times to do this, but I just haven't done it or I ended up stopping my logs. I'm going to attempt
        to keep the logs going here on my website. ye. <br><br>

        6/12/19 15:00-15:30 <br>
        Shortly after opening my todo.html, I was able to figure out how to clear the textbox when creating
        a task and also make the "enter" key trigger the add task button click. I was able to do this because
        my googling skills have gotten better.. ha.. ha, nah. Anyway I talked with my mentor and let him know
        I was going to improve my todo.html by making some sort of saving ability. He recommended I use local storage.
        I don't know anything about that yet, but I will soon enough because I will google it obviously.
        That's about all that happened in my 30 minutes. Thx 4 ur time. <br><br>

        6/12/19 15:30-19:00 <br>
        Sometime after programming, I talked with my mentor. He said that I was supposed to be writing a short log every
        25 minutes. I misunderstood and thought he meant to start programming for 25 minutes and write a log for
        that short amount of time without re-logging the rest of the day. That was what I was supposed to do... hmm...
        I didn't get a lot of things done on my own within the time frame. My mentor helped me out for a lot of the 
        work. The good news is that I was able to understand what was going on and learned about local storage and
        how to implement it in html. Much of JS is still new to me so I have been struggling to figure out how to do
        anything. The to do list is not yet complete, but it looks good so far, thanks to me and my mentor... ha..
        <br><br>

        6/13/19 16:00-22:00 <br>
        Damn, I learned a lot today. I didn't really learn that much from the tutorial that my mentor suggested to me,
        but I did learn how to learn better. Instead of just watching tons of tutorials and then trying to make something
        at the end, I created small assignments for myself along the way in a fun way so it wasn't boring. The 6 hours flew
        by so fast... amazing... I learned how to sit down and code like I was able to do during my spring session at Sac state.
        Makes me feel good about myself.
        I also learned the more indepth details of variables, constants, and etc of JS. I ended up watching 14 videos of the 
        tutorial, but that was because I skipped 3-4 of them since I knew about those topics already. That's about it, good day. <br><br>

        6/14/19 10:00-17:00 <br>
        I forgot to write my log after doing my time, so I'm logging this on the 15th. During my 5 hour study session, I started to feel
        worn out and tired, but I didn't give up. I kept rewatching a certain motivational video on YouTube until I started to code again.
        As I coded, I felt like I actually WANTED to code. On the day I started logging (6/11), I didn't want to code. It felt like a chore.
        Something that was boring and something that I didn't want to do. For some reason in 3 days, I was able to change my mindset.
        I realized how uneducated I am in coding and realized how much I wanted to get better. My life isn't a lot like my friend's lives, where
        they have parents to catch them when they fall. On the other hand, I have to catch myself before I fall. A lot of my friends
        don't realize their current state in life. They don't realize how uneducated they are and don't have a drive to get better.
        They may think they do, but I don't think they do. I am still somewhat like them, because I hang around them so much. I used to
        lay around and do nothing with them. I would just hang out all the time. I started thinking for myself and if I keep hanging out so much
        then I'm going to end up just like them. I'll be lazy, doing nothing all the time, sleeping until 12PM not doing shit. I don't want to 
        be like that. No matter how hard it is to get better, I want to get better. I didn't talk about coding much this time, but I believe this
        self reflection log is more beneficial than a coding summary for 6/14. <br><br>

        6/15/19 12:00-18:00 <br>
        Once again, I am writing the log for 6/15 on 6/16. I'm falling behind a day. I'm starting to get lazy writing these logs, but I remember
        some motivational quotes like, "I HAMMER ON THE PROJECT" and it helps me out to just do it, man. 6/16 didn't feel too productive. I got some
        headaches due to my weak posture (using weak/strong posture is better than saying bad/good posture because saying posture is weak means that
        posture can be strengthened). As for what I learned while programming, I added textbox inputs and attemepted to loop through some buttonlistenerevents
        so I did not have to recreate 5 button listener events. I was not successful, YET. HAHA. After failing to solve the button listener problem, I moved on
        to watching tutorials. A lot of the tutorial was material I already knew, so I skimmed/skipped through a bunch. I think I'm on video 25 now.
        After that, I fixed up some typoes and other things. I forgot. I really didn't want to write this log. That is all. Hammer on. <br><br>
 
        6/16/19 12:00-15:50 <br>
        Time to catch up on my logs. I'm disappointed in myself today. I wanted to hit at least 6 hours. I only did about 3 and a half of coding. Damn.
        However, in this short amount of time, I felt more productive than I was yesterday. I didn't watch any tutorials, but I added CSS to my
        website tutorial page. I changed the font, made a dymanic number system for the sections, put a background for the slowpoke, put tomato color
        behind the headings, fixed typoes, added emphasis, underlined subsections, and fixed the date. Sure sounds like a lot, DOESN'T IT? HUH?
        Well, I'm planning to code more tomorrow and get even more CSS things done. Thank you for your time. I can't wait to see me in 2-3 years with
        this pace. <br><br>

        6/17/19 3 hours (Don't remember time)<br> 
        I forgot what I did this day. I didn't do much so It's not worth logging. What I did do was spend time with my family. We went to
        dinner for father's day. I learned about how one of my friends is living at my dad's house now with my cousin, Junior. There's a long and sad
        story behind why. That's about it for today, just goof'd off like a monkey. <br><br>

        6/18/19 10:00-22:00 <br>
        Grinded through all the tutorials today. Some of them were a little confusing so I couldn't write docs for them, yet. I'm going to do some
        more reasearch on the topics I didn't understand so I can write examples and code snippets. I think I added a Google search bar during
        this session. I also added about 9 sections, most of them incomplete. They are only incomplete at the moment because they aren't as
        necessary as the other sections. However, I will get back to them later to solidify my knowledge of said topics. I just felt like this session
        was long and a bunch of grinding, because I don't remember much of what I did besides watch tutorial and write some code along with it... 
        What an unsatisfying log. <br><br>

        6/19/19 11:00-17:00 <br>
        This session was good. Even though I went to Golfland with my girlfriend, I was still able to get lots of programming time in.
        Currently, my clock is at 6 hours and counting. Even though on my website it looks like I haven't done much with those 6 hours, I learned many things
        such as implementing code onto the website page (what?), closure, some nitty gritty things about tags, ran into errors that I was able to fix, and etc.
        Now if I run into those same problems, I can fix them EASILY. I really did not want to write these logs, but you know, gotta 
        <font color="red"><strong><em>HAMMER</em></strong></font>
        on the project. That is it for now, thanks for your time. <br><br>

        6/20/19 2 hours <br> 
        Man, what are you even doing? What are you doing Ronny? Today was just utter TRASH. All I did was NOTHING. Cmon, don't you want to get better at
        programming? At your future job? Don't you want to be one of the best programmers amongst your peers? You can do it dude... Just do it..
        That's all I can say for today. <br><br>

        6/21/19 1 hour <br>
        It was only 1 hour, but it was a producutive hour. Still, disappointed at myself. My abilities... are failing. My brain, becoming MUSH. <br><br>

        6/22/19 1 hour <br>
        Ronny's mind, beginning to falter... But no more... The storm is coming...<br><br>

        6/23/19 1 hour <br>
        Not worth logging. Disappointed. <br><br>

        6/24/19 11:00-19:00<br>
        For this log, I'm going to reflect on what I did the past few days and what I did today. In the past few days I regret not going to work. It was fun
        just goofing around, but I didn't progress in my journey. I didn't progress in learning about JavaScript. However, I did learn a lesson from goofing off.
        I learned that after I started programming and started to slack off, my brain just kept telling me that I should be programming. I felt wrong doing anything
        if I didn't get my hours in. Was the goofing off worth it? No. Did I learn from it? Yes.<br><br>

        6/25/19 8 hours<br>
        Don't remember, forgot to log.<br><br>

        6/26/19 8 hours<br>
        I think I finished the tutorial here, no wait that was 6/25. I edited my tutorial page and then started working on the drums.html.<br><br>

        6/27/19 8 hours<br>
        Not a very productive day. Got stuck on trying to make the buttons "active" for the longest time. Holy moly... Added some CSS to my drums
        page and made the buttons work better than before. Buttons used to get stuck, but now they don't. Still not optimal, but it's fine. 
        Logs aren't very good at the moment because I need to catch up and I forgot what I did those days.<br><br>

        6/28/19 10:00-18:00<br>
        Today wasn't bad. Finished all/most of my drums.html. Learned how to manipulate buttons and some annoying things about buttons getting smooshed together.
        Also found out that listening to the same song over and over like I used to really helps improve focus. Not sure why. I took many breaks, some were
        "cheat" breaks where I just messed around, and some were needed breaks to help improve creativity and thinking. People need to take breaks, or else
        they can get burnt out and not even know it. Even I can't fully be programming for 8 hours for 5 days a week. It's almost impossible, at least right now...
        Here comes the storm.<br><br>

        6/29/19 4 hours<br>
        Today was bad. I learned a little about jquery, but I was just distracted the whole time. Losing my path, but trying to get back on.<br><br>

        6/30/19 1 hour<br>
        Did some more jquery programming, and wasn't much. My mentor showed me a video of a TED talk about breaking bad habits. I rewatched it again
        and will try the method of being mindful while I'm about to perform a bad habit. Just be curious.<br><br>

        7/1/19 ~8 hours<br>
        Started to get back on track today. I was still distracted though so today didn't feel good. I could feel it. Everyone around me could feel it.
        This feeling of being bad, being unproductive. But I did learn a lot about taxes, yes.<br><br>

        7/2/19 ~8 hours<br>
        Garbage.<br><br>

        7/3/19 ~8 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Today was really good. Had complete focus for about 6 hours. I figured out the difference between SQL and databases. SQL is a language used
        to MANIPULATE databases. I thought that SQL was used to create databases. There are programs that are made where databases can be created,
        but I was trying to learn how to make a database, not really managing one. My mentor sent me a link to a good guide that tells you how to 
        create a simple database. While following the tutorial, I learned while doing, which is what I should be doing. Always look back on this.
        ALWAYS LEARN WHILE DOING OR LEARN WHAT IS NEEDED. Do not follow school style teaching. It is NOT good.<br><br>

        7/4/19 2 hours<br>
        Holiday... Did only 2 hours.<br><br>

        7/5/19 8 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Goals today: 1-Use vim shortcuts better. 2-Finish database tutorial. 3-Start on Paul's challenge 4-End up trying to create authentication system.
        So I achieved 1, 2, 3, and 4. What I learned during these 8 hours was PHP, SQL, MySQL, more debugging, using vim better, more about databases,
        and more. PHP is still new to me, so following the tutorial was helpful, but I can't replicate it on my own, yet. SQL was also used, and MySQL.
        With the help of my mentor, I was able to understand how to start/stop an apache2/MySQL server and some more things about the linux commands.
        I figured out that the mysql commandline or whatever it's called is like coding in an editor but just by typing SQL expressions (Idk how to explain
        what this means). This is really good for me cause I'm starting to RAMP up and HAMMER on. Thank u. <br><br>

        7/6/19 4 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Goals: 1-Learn correct terminology (ex. bash, linux, ubuntu, environment, etc). 2-Work on authentication.
        3-Callous your mind. 4-UH make posting system.<br>
        Finished making authentication system. Still need to study on how it was made, since I just copied it from someone.
        Googled some information on terminology and now I understand what most of the differences and similarities are.<br><br>

        7/7/19 8 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Goals: 1-Try to get the 8 hours. It will be hard. 2-Get close to finishing/finish posting system. 3-Use PHP SQL MYSQL to make something<br>
        What I learned today: More about PHP, SQL, MySQL, server vs client side scripting, css, show php errors, show table fields (DESCRIBE)...
        I was able to edit the index.php page to add a posting section that then gets sent to the database when the submit button is pressed.
        I learned more about how to use php variables like $_SESSION, $_POST, and not sure what else. Now I just have to make the data
        appear on the webpage under the post stuff. Ok what I actually did was I made a new table in my test database
        and was able to get the content from a textarea and put it into the content column. I made the css look nice for the page by looking at the
        copied code I got. Looked up PHP and SQL functions and other things yno.<br><br>
        
        7/8/19 8 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Goals: 1-Finish posting system. 2-Think of something to do. 3-Make edit button for posting system. <br>
        Learned: More about $_POST and $_GET, TRUNCATE TABLE, php variables, outputting data table from database,
        little bit about echo, isset, trim, if-else, mysqli, $result,
        What I did: Added title textbox for inserting a title name, if no title is given then title is set to "Untitled."
        Added placeholders and changed page style, Added timestamp, title, and content in a cleaner format under the
        post area. Added edit buttons, but they don't work, yet. Sat around trying to think of a way to get the
        buttons depending on the id. I think I was able to do that, but now I need a textbox to come up or someting
        so that the user can edit that post. Probably going to make a separate page and then allow them to update it there.
        Ex. At the top put the original post and a header that says they're editing that post. Then under have an 
        edit area. Tested posting for different accounts, fixed some bugs, etc...<br><br>

        7/9/19 8 hours 10:00-18:00<br>
        Goals: 1-Get Edit button to work. 2-Make it so only the user of the post can edit their own post. 3-Time and date of
        edit. 4-...<br>
        Learned: htmlspecialchars, =&gt;, submit on form, some other things.<br>
        NOTES: The button has the ID of the post. Now it just has to go to a new page with that post ID. HOW?<br>
        Did: Got the edit button to work!!! YES!! Edit button redirects to new php page that allows user to edit the title
        and content of the selected post. Added delete button that deletes the selected post. Added clear posts button
        for easier bug testing, not meant to be in final product. There are still a lot of bugs like after submitting
        an edit, the title and contents just go blank after submission which is not intended.<br><br>

        7/10/19 8 hours 8:15-16:15<br>
        Goals: 1-Start making website using php 2-...<br>
        Learned: More about git, less about github,<br>
        Did: Updated git, watched videos on git and version control, cloned git repository and deleted it cause I didn't
        know what I was doing, ruined 2 git repos by somehow merging them and overwriting using INTELLIJ, read the git
        tutorial. I ended up being unable to undo what I did. Unfortunately I'm going to have to leave the 2 repositories
        merged. I think I set the URL's to one or something. Spent most of the studying/all of it trying to figure this out.<br><br>

        7/11/19 8 hours<br>
        Goals: 1-Get good distance on PHP website. 2-
