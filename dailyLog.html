    <h1>Daily Log</h1>
    <p>
        6/11/19: <br>
        It's been over 25 minutes since I started coding. I'm supposed to log after doing SOMETHING for 25 minutes.
        Since this is the first log, I'll go easy on me. I opened up my todo.html to see what
        I wanted to implement. I want to make it so my to do list goes down vertically and not horizontally.
        Right now the new task button is not doing what I intended. I started to google things like,
        "How to append new line in js" or "How to make a line break using button," but it was useless.
        I still couldn't find the answer to my question. So I thought I should look at it a different way.
        I just googled how to make a to do list and there was an example. I took look at it so I could
        have a place to start. That's when my mentor told me to make this daily log thing. He's actually told me
        multiple times to do this, but I just haven't done it or I ended up stopping my logs. I'm going to attempt
        to keep the logs going here on my website. ye.
