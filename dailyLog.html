    <h1>Daily Log</h1>

        It's been over 25 minutes since I started coding. I'm supposed to log after doing SOMETHING for 25 minutes.
        Since this is the first log, I'll go easy on me. I opened up my todo.html to see what
        I wanted to implement. I want to make it so my to do list goes down vertically and not horizontally.
        Right now the new task button is not doing what I intended. I started to google things like,
        "How to append new line in js" or "How to make a line break using button," but it was useless.
        I still couldn't find the answer to my question. So I thought I should look at it a different way.
        I just googled how to make a to do list and there was an example. I took look at it so I could
        have a place to start. That's when my mentor told me to make this daily log thing. He's actually told me
        multiple times to do this, but I just haven't done it or I ended up stopping my logs. I'm going to attempt
        to keep the logs going here on my website. ye. <br><br>

        Shortly after opening my todo.html, I was able to figure out how to clear the textbox when creating
        a task and also make the "enter" key trigger the add task button click. I was able to do this because
        my googling skills have gotten better.. ha.. ha, nah. Anyway I talked with my mentor and let him know
        I was going to improve my todo.html by making some sort of saving ability. He recommended I use local storage.
        I don't know anything about that yet, but I will soon enough because I will google it obviously.
        That's about all that happened in my 30 minutes. Thx 4 ur time. <br><br>
