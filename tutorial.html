        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <h2>Primitive Types</h2>
        <h3>Integer, Floating-point, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol</h3>
        <p>
            age = 13
        </p>
        <button id="legal">Change age to 18</button>
        <p class="nope" hidden>
            You cannot change the value of a primitive type once it is declared. <br>
            It is immutable.
        </p>
        <pre class="nope" hidden><code class="nope" hidden>
        Example: 
        let age = 13;
        age = 18; 
        console.log(age);
        </code></pre>
        <p class="nope" hidden>
            The console will log 18, but age is not modified. age = 18 is creating a new age variable instead. <br>
            Strings work in the same way. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Object Types</h2>
        <h3>Array, Date, Regular Expression, Map and WeakMap, Set and WeakSet</h3>
        <p>
            In JS, almost "everything" is an object. All JS values, except primitives, are objects.
            Objects are mutable and their values can be changed at anytime. Objects are Variables.
            But objects can contain many values. <br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        Example: var person = {firstName:"Ron", lastName:"Doe", age:22, eyeColor:"brown"};
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The named values in JS objects are called <strong>properties</strong><br>
            In the example above, the properties are firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor. Their respective values
            are Ron, Doe, 22, and brown. Objects are name value pairs, similar to... <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Associative arrays in PHP</li>
            <li>Dictionaries in Python</li>
            <li>Hash tables in C</li>
            <li>Hash maps in Java</li> 
            <li>Hashes in Ruby and Perl.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Array</h3>
        <p>
            Can be any type of data like objects or primitive types. The array size is not fixed, can remove and add. <br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="date">Date</h3>
        <p>
            Represent date and time. Used to get or set date for an event. Can also specify time using date of object.
        </p>
        <h3>Regular Expression</h3>
        <p>
            Sub language of JS. Used to Perform Complex search and replace operations on strings. Once you create a
            symbol it is unique and it will not match any other symbols. This will be covered later.
        </p>
        <h3>Maps and sets</h3>
        <p>
            Like an object, but offers more advantages than object in some situations..? Will be covered more later.
        </p>

        <h1>Destructing Assignment Operator</h1>
        <p>
            Destructing in JavaScript allows for data extraction from arrays and objects, then allowing
            you to assign them into variables.<br>
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        var allOfIt = ["Hello", "World"];
        var hello = allOfIt[0];
        var world = allOfIt[1];

        console.log(hello + " " + world);
        </code></pre>
        <hr>

        <h1>Array and Object Operators</h1>
        <p>
            Example: <br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        const obj = {id: "18", name: "Ron"}; 
        console.log(obj.["name"]); // output is: Ron
        //Creating a class: 
        class Model { 
            constructor() {

            }
        </code></pre>
        <hr>

        <h1>Instance of and Conditional (Ternary) Operator (?:)</h1>
        <pre><code>
        const d = new Date(); 
        console.log(d instanceof Date); // output is: true 
        //Example of Conditional Operator:
        hi = hi ? hi : "Hello"; // If hi is true, it will return the hi variable
        //if the expression is false, hi will be set to "Hello".
        </code></pre>
        <hr>

        <h1>Jump Statements</h1>
        <p>
            The break statement "jumps out" of a loop. Continue "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
            A jump statement that I know well is <em>return</em>. <br><br>
            Example: <br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        let start = true;
        stopLoop: while(start) {
            console.log("ihaa");
            break stopLoop; 
        }

        <h1>Anonymous Functions, Exciting</h1>
        <p>
            Example: function() {}; <br>
            Anonymous functions can be assigned by using an expression. (Need to check if this is correct).<br>
            Example in source code again.

        <h1>Arrow Notation (33)</h1>
        <p>
            Helps reduce the amount of times we have to type, "function." <br> 
            1. The function keyword can be omitted. <br>
            2. If the function has a single parameter, then parentheses can be omitted. <br>
            3. If the function has a single statement, curly braces can be omitted. <br>
        </p>

        <h1>Global and Local Scope</h1>
        <h2>Global Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Variables declared outside a function become <em>GLOBAL</em><br>
            Therefore, the global variable will have global scope: All scripts and functions on a webpage
            can access it.
        </p>
        <h3>Automatically Global</h3>
        <p>
            If a value is assigned to a variable that has not been declared, 
            it will automatically become <em>GLOBAL</em>.<br>
            Example: <br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        createCar(); 
        function createCar() {
        &emsp;make = "Toyota"; 
        } 
        </code></pre>
        Make is a global variable in this case.

        <h2>Local Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Variables declared inside a function become <em>LOCAL</em> to the function.<br>
            Therefore the variables can only be accessed within the function.
        </p>
        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <p>Coming soon...</p>
        <hr>

        <h1>Closure</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. <br>
            Using closures, global variables can be made local (private). <br>
            There are many problems with variable scope and w3schools.com
            has good exmaples of that. Here I will just show the things that I
            have trouble understanding the most. <br>
            Using nested functions, we can create a function within another.
            As stated in w3schools, all functions have access to the scope "above" them. <br>
            Nested functions have access to the scope "above" them. <br><br>
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        function add() {
            var counter = 0;
            function plus() { counter += 1;}
            plus();
            return counter;
        }

        add();
        add();
        add();

        // Something about self-invoking functions (need to research this).
        // Now using closure:
        var add = (function() {
            var counter = 0;
            return function() {counter += 1; return counter}
        })();

        add();
        add();
        add();
        // The code now functions properly, the counter = 3;

        <h1>Let vs Var</h1>
        <p>
            To be honest, trying to figure out the difference is confusing for me, at least, for now...<br>
            Here's what I got so far, but I don't fully understand.<br>
            var is "function scope" and let is "block scope." JavaScript also has something called, "hoisting." <br>
            Here's an example and explanation of what hoisting does:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        function printHello() {
        // This is what JavaScript does...
        // It will, in my words, "pre-declare" the vars as if the code looks like this:
        // var hi, ok, example, yes; // But they will be undefined since they are set later.
        // There is NO ERROR, but the variables will be UNDEFINED until they reach the point where they
        // are defined.

            // What JavaScript will do is have this "invisible" line of code below.
            // var hi, yes, ok, example;
            console.log(hi);
            var hi = "uhh";
            if (yes) {
                var ok = "sure";
                console.log(ok);
            } else {
                var example = "whatever";
                console.log(example);
            }
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            let can only be used within "blocks." What that means is if you have a for loop or
            an if statement, the variables inside
            the loop can only be used within the {} of the loop or statement.
            let can't be used outside of where it has been declared.
            (This is the case for most coding languages, I think). <br>
            The Coding Train guy does a good job explaining, even though he rambles in the beginning. <br>

        <p></p> 

        <h1>Objects</h1>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, an object is a container.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        const obj = {
            name: "Ron",
            value: 22
        };
        </code></pre>
        <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main differences, elements in an array can be accessed by indices.
                On the other hand objects can be accessed by strings or symbols.
                Example in source.
            </p>

        <h1>OOP</h1>
        <pre><code>
        const obj = {};

        console.log(obj.uhh); // You can get object property created from THE reference.

        <hr>

        <h1>Classes</h1>
        <p>
            Very useful, should add some examples. Classes in JavaScript are almost like Java classes.<br>
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        class car {
            constructor(make, model) {
                this.make = make;
                this.model = model;
            }
        }

        show() {
            console.log(`make: ${this.make}
            model: ${this.model}`);
        // And to create instances:
        const car1 = new car("Toyota", "Corolla");
        const car2 = new car();
        </code></pre>
        <hr>

        <h1>Prototype</h1>
        <p>
            Every function has a special prototype property. Dynamic dispatch?<br>
            You can't add a new property to an existing object constructor. To add a new property
            to a constructor, you must add it to the constructor function directly.
            But this is where prototyping comes in. The prototype property allows you to add new properties
            to object constructors. You can also add new methods to object constructors.

        <pre><code>
        //Example:

        function Human(gender, age, height) {
            this.gender = gender;
            this.age = age;
            this.height = height;
        }

        Human.prototype.nationality = "English";
        //Human.natonality = "English" // DOES NOT WORK
        </code></pre>

        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Looks important, solidify this.</em><br>
            Uses extend keyword, will allow reusee of properties and methods of the parent class to
            the child class. Example in JavaScript source code.
        </p>

        <h1>Map() Revisited</h1>
        <p>
            ECMAScript 6 introduced a new data structure called maps. Maps are just like objects where
            they can map a key to a value. Tutorial explanation unclear after this point, need to do
            outside research. Map examples in source.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h1>WeakMap()</h1>
        <p>
            Idential to the map object, but with 3 disparities. <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Weak map keys must be an object.</li>
                <li>Weak map can't be iterated or cleared.</li>
                <li>Keys in weak maps can be garbage collected?</li>
            </ol>
            Garbage collection: Performed automatically and is invisible to us. The garbage collection
            takes care of memory management in JavaScript.<br>
            Weakmaps are good for having private things, I'm not fully sure what that means, yet.
        </p> 
        <hr>

        <h1>Set Objects (WeakSet(), Set())</h1>
        <p>
            Identical to map object, but set object lets you store unique values of any type...?
            collection of data where duplicates are not allowed (oh ok).
        </p>

        <h1>DOM (Document Object Model)</h1>
        <p>
            According to DOM, all html tags are objects. The text specified in the tag is also an object, all
            accessible through JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h2>DOM Tree</h2>
        <p>
            Conceptually, DOM is a tree. A tree consists of nodes. Every node has parents. The root node is
            document. huh? has only one child HTML? HUH? The HTML element has two children, the title and the head.<br>
            DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. The DOM object defines the
            HTML element as an object.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Using DOM in the Browser</h2>
        <p>
            Using the DOM object, you can change HTML elements and attributes, create HTML elements,
            remove attributes, add and change CSS, react to events (Pretty much what I've been doing to
            build this tutorial.html page).<br>
            Some examples are using the document object like document.getElementById(); (DOM METHODS)
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h1>QuerySelector() and QuerySelectorAll()</h1>
        <p>
            QuerySelector() will return the first matched element. Using QuerySelectorAll(), as you guessed,
            gets ALL the elements.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        let para = document.querySelector("p"); // Use #p to access by id.
        console.log(para);

        para.innerHTML = "Paragraph";

        let para = document.querySelectorAll(".para"); // returns a nodelist object
        // para now contains the collection of nodes from .para
        // The nodes can be accessed using an index
        para[0].innerHTML = "hi";
        </code></pre>
        <hr>

            <input type="submit" class="submit" />
        <hr>

        <h1>Dynamic Nodes using DOM</h1>
        <p>
            Element.createElement(tagName);<br>
            For example,<br>
            let p1 = document.createElement("p");<br>
            let p2 = document.createElement("p");<br>

            // Specify text using textContent property.<br>
            p1.textContent = "First paragraph;<br>
            p2.textContent = "Second paragraph;<br>
            // Need to use appendchild method to append parahraph to the DOM.<br>
            const content = document.querySelector(".conntent");<br>
            content.appendChild(p1);<br>
            content.appendChild(p2);<br><br>
            // To append to the body, do<br>
            document.body.appendChild(p2);<br>

            DOM gives us full control of the HTML elements.<br>
            p1.setAttribute("class", "para1"); // Setting the class attribute to para1<br>
            p1.removeAttribute("class"); // Removes class attribute.<br>
        </p>

        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>
            An action performed by the user. There are close to 200 types of events in JavaScript.
            I've been using events since I started this page so i'll add on to this later.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h1>Focus and Blur Events</h1>
        <p>
            Looks simple, will do research later. An example would be inputting a username and password
            for a website. Usually the textbox will have a placeholder like "username" and when it is clicked
            it will be in focus. Then while out of focus it will return to "username".

        <h1>Jquery()</h1>
        <p>
            POWERFUL and popular JavaScript language library. It is used to manipulate DOM elements and
            executing ajax requests. Very simple, and also simplifies your JavaScript code.
        </p>
        There are 3 main features of jquery:
        <ol>
            <li>Lightweight</li>
            <li>Variety of plugins</li>
            <li>Designer friendly library</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Jquery needs to be included to be used.

        <h1>Modules</h1>
        <p>
            A piece of reusable JavaScript code. Modules are meant to be created so that code is reused.
            Important, research more on this. Tutorial not good.

        <h1>AJAX</h1>
        <p>
            Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. A set of development techniques used for building websites and
            web applications. Basically it's used to update web content asynchronously. JavaScript is used to create,
            add, and manage dynamic website content. It is also used to control features that require real time updates
            while a visitor is viewing a page. XML is used to transfer data stored on the page to the browsers that
            view it. Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with DOM and JavaScript for dynamic content
            display. A user can keep using the application while the clinet program requests info from the server
            in the background.

        <h2>Window (The Browser Object Model (BOM))</h2>
        <p>
            The window object represents the brower's window (amazing). <br>
            All global JavaScript objects, functions, and varaibles automatically become
            members of the window object. <br>
            Window methods can be viewed at this page: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window.asp
