        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <h2>Primitive Types</h2>
        <h3>integer, floating-point, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol</h3>
        <p>She's 13, but she's primitive</p>
        <button id="legal">Make her 18 anyway</button>
        <p id="nope" hidden> You cannot change the value of a primitive type once it is declared. <br>
        It is immutable. <br>
        Example: <br>
        let age = 13; <br>
        age = 18; <br>
        console.log(age); <br>
        The console will log 18, but age is not modified. It is creating a new variable instead. <br>
        Strings work in the same way. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Object Types</h2>
        <h3>Array, Date, Regulat Expression, Map and WeakMap, Set and WeakSet</h3>
        <p>In JS, almost "everything" is an object. All JS values, except primitives, are objects.
        Objects are mutable and their values can be changed at anytime. Objects are like Containers? and
        can have different kind of data??? LITERAL? {}. Press F12 to see an object in the script tag.
        </p>
        <h3>Array</h3>
        <p>Can be any type of data like objects or primitive types. The array size is not fixed, can remmove and add <br>
        <h3 id="date">Date</h3>
        <div id="txt"></div>
        <p>Represent date and time. Used to get or set date for an event. Can also specify time using date of object.</p>
        <h3>Regular Expression</h3>
        <p>Sub language of JS. Used to Perform Complex search and replace operations on strings. Once you create a
        symbol it is unique and it will not match any other symbols. This will be covered later.
        <h3>Maps and sets</h3>
        <p>Like an object, but offers more advantages than object in some situations..? Will be covered more later.</p>

        <h1>String</h1>
        <p>Simple text data. A collection of characters, numbers, and symbols. In JS, string represents Unicode text</p>

        <h1>Loops</h1>
        <p>Assignment coming soon...</p>
        <h3>For in loop</h3>
        <p>Exercise: <br>
        Create some objects and loop through them.
